# Your rule content

- If you want to create a new file, always search for an existed file with similar name before creating a new file.
- This project use `pnpm`, so please use `pnpm exec` if it's better rather than using `npx`.
- Always search for related files in the context, no assumption upon existing code with similar trained code, that's a source of bug.
- Tech stack of this web app is: Next.js 15 + React 19, ZenStack + Prisma ORM, Docker, Shadcn/ui, Auth.js, Playwright for E2E testing.
- When I say to run a command in background, remember to use the `run_terminal_cmd` tool with `is_background` set to true.
- Command to install shadcn/ui components `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`.
- Propose the modification plan first then wait for my confirmation. Don't just modify files at your own will.
- For frontend development, split the page into smaller components to increase the code clarity, readability and reusability
- Always use `shadcn/ui` components for UI development instead pure html elements if possible.
- Remember about Server Actions of Next.js and add "use server" directive.
- After schema changes, remember to run necessary commands in `package.json` to rebuild the client
- You don't have to restart the `pnpm dev` server since this can watch over changes in codebase
- `params` in Next.js 15 now is a Promise object and need to be awaited before being used.
