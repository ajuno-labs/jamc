### **Project Scope: Q&A Platform with LMS Integration**

This project focuses on developing a **Q&A platform** that integrates with a **basic Learning Management System (LMS)**. The LMS serves only as a structural backbone, providing course/module organization and linking users to relevant Q&A discussions. The emphasis is on the **Q&A functionalities**, ensuring an efficient and structured knowledge-sharing system for students and teachers.
