### **Project Scope: Math-Focused Q&A Platform with LMS Integration**

This project focuses on developing a **math-oriented Q&A platform** that integrates with a **basic Learning Management System (LMS)**. The platform is designed specifically for mathematics education, with LaTeX support for displaying mathematical formulas. The LMS provides course/module organization with text and link-based content, while the Q&A system enables efficient knowledge sharing between teachers and students.

## **Core Features**

### **1. Course Management**
- Teachers can **create, edit, and manage** course content with a fixed structure.
- **LaTeX support** for displaying mathematical formulas in course materials.
- Basic text and link-based content (no video support initially).
- Important content can be **bookmarked** for easy navigation.

### **2. Question & Answer System**
- Students can **post questions**, teachers or other students can **provide answers**.
- **LaTeX support** in both questions and answers for mathematical formulas.
- Teachers can mark **official answers**.
- Questions are **categorized by tags and topics** for easy searching.
- **Voting system** to rank helpful answers.
- Teachers can **edit, delete, or pin** important questions.

### **3. Search & Filtering**
- Full-text **search functionality** across course content and Q&A.
- Filtering by **topics, teachers, or relevant tags**.

### **4. Notification System**
- Notifications for **new answers** or **content updates**.
- Option to **follow** specific questions, lessons, or topics.

### **5. Feedback & Rating System**
- Students can provide **feedback** on lessons, learning materials, and Q&A content.

### **6. LMS-Q&A Integration**
- Questions in the Q&A system are **linked to specific course content**.
- Course pages **display related discussions** from the Q&A system.
- **Bookmarking feature** helps students easily navigate back to important lessons.
- Teacher dashboard to track students progress.

### **7. User Management**
- **Registration and login** with role-based permissions (Teacher, Student).
- **Profile management** for personal information and activity tracking.

### **8. Gamification**
- **Reputation points** based on participation (asking, answering, receiving upvotes).
- **Badges** for achievements (e.g., answering many questions, receiving most upvotes).
- **Leaderboards** displaying top contributors.
- **Learning challenges** (daily/weekly tasks) to encourage participation.

### **9. AI-powered Enhancements (Planned for Future)**
- **Auto-suggest similar questions** when posting to reduce duplicates.
- **AI-generated suggested answers** based on previous responses.
- **Sentiment analysis** for flagging inappropriate content.
