# Tech Stack

## **Core Stack**

**Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS  
- Type safety with TypeScript  
- Server-side rendering for SEO  
- Tailwind for rapid UI development  

**Backend**: Next.js API Routes/Server Actions + ZenStack + Prisma  
- Keep full-stack in a single framework  
- Prisma for type-safe database operations  

**Database**: PostgreSQL (+ I'm considering Supabase, but it's not really a good choice for this project)
- Relational structure fits educational data  
- Supabase adds real-time capabilities + auth  
- Free tier suitable for early stages  

**AI/ML** (Optional): Python (FastAPI), and sth more but I haven't done any research yet

**Authentication**: Auth.js  
- Support for social logins + school credentials  
- Role-based access control (teachers/students)
