Okay, so I need to test the OAuth login in my project that uses Prisma ORM, Vercel, and Auth.js. But I don't want to use a real Google account. Hmm, how do I approach this?

First, I remember that Auth.js (formerly NextAuth) supports different providers, including Google. But testing OAuth usually requires hitting the real provider's endpoints, which would require actual user accounts. But using real accounts in testing is risky and inconvenient. Maybe there's a way to mock or simulate the OAuth flow?

Wait, maybe Auth.js has a way to handle testing environments. Let me check their documentation. Oh right, they mention using a mock provider or a test provider in development. Or perhaps using a fake OAuth server?

Alternatively, maybe I can use a testing strategy like end-to-end tests with a headless browser, but that might still require real accounts. Not ideal. What about environment variables? If I set the NODE_ENV to test, can I bypass OAuth?

Another thought: Auth.js allows for custom providers. Could I create a dummy provider for testing that doesn't require real credentials? That might work. Let me think about how to set that up.

Wait, there's also the option of using a library like MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept the OAuth requests and mock the responses. That way, I don't hit the real Google servers. But I need to mock the entire OAuth handshake, which includes redirects and token exchanges. That could be complex, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, maybe Auth.js has a built-in way to handle this. Oh, right! In the Auth.js configuration, you can override the providers in certain environments. For example, in development or test mode, you could use a credentials provider instead of Google. So during testing, users can log in with a username and password without OAuth. But then, how does that test the actual OAuth flow?

Hmm. Maybe I need a hybrid approach. Use the real OAuth provider but with test accounts provided by Google. Wait, Google does have test accounts, but setting those up might take time. Or maybe use a service like OAuth.tools which provides a mock OAuth server. But that might require changing the provider configuration in the app.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the testing environment: local development vs. CI/CD.

2. Decide whether to mock the OAuth server or use test accounts.

3. Configure Auth.js to use the mock or test provider in testing.

4. Write tests that simulate the login flow.

5. Verify that the user is authenticated and session is created.

Alternatively, if using Prisma, maybe I can check the database after the OAuth flow to see if the user was created correctly. But that still requires triggering the OAuth process.

Wait, maybe using Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing. They can automate the browser, but handling OAuth requires dealing with multiple steps. Some services allow for test credentials that can be automated. For example, Google allows setting up test users with pre-defined credentials. So maybe create a test Google account, use its credentials in the test, and automate the login with those. But that's using a real account, albeit a test one. Still, it's a real account, which might not be desired.

Alternatively, some OAuth providers offer a sandbox environment. Does Google have that? Not exactly, but you can create a project in Google Cloud specifically for testing, set up test users there, and use those. That way, you're not using real user accounts but test ones tied to your project. That might be a viable approach.

So, steps would be:

1. In Google Cloud Console, create a test project or use the existing one.

2. Under OAuth consent screen, add test users (email addresses of test accounts).

3. Create test Google accounts (maybe using a service like TempMail or just dummy accounts).

4. Use these test accounts in automated tests.

5. Configure Auth.js to use the test project's client ID and secret.

But managing test accounts could be a hassle. Plus, automated tests might need to handle 2FA if those accounts have it enabled, which they shouldn't. So ensure test accounts have 2FA off.

Alternatively, use a library like `@playwright/test` to automate the OAuth flow with test credentials. Here's a rough outline:

- In the test, navigate to the login page.

- Click the Google login button.

- Fill in the test Google account's email and password in the Google OAuth form.

- Submit and wait for redirect.

- Check if the user is logged in.

But this requires handling the Google OAuth UI, which might change, making tests brittle. Also, Google might block automated login attempts if detected.

Another approach: use a mocked version of the OAuth provider during testing. For example, in the test environment, replace the Google provider with a custom one that mimics the OAuth flow but doesn't require real credentials. Auth.js allows adding custom providers. So in the test setup, override the providers array to use a mocked version.

For example, create a custom OAuth provider that, instead of redirecting to Google, redirects to a mocked endpoint that generates a fake token. Then, in the Auth.js configuration, handle this token and create a user session. This way, the test can simulate the entire flow without hitting Google's servers.

This requires some setup:

1. Create a mock OAuth provider in Auth.js.

2. Configure the application to use this mock provider when in testing mode.

3. In tests, trigger the login with the mock provider.

4. Verify that the session is created and the user is authenticated.

This approach avoids real OAuth calls and allows controlled testing. However, it doesn't test the actual integration with Google, just the flow. But it's useful for unit/integration tests.

Alternatively, if you want to test the actual Google integration, using a test account and automated E2E tests is the way to go. But that requires handling the UI and potential flakiness.

So, the user wants to avoid using real accounts. Therefore, the best approach is to mock the OAuth provider in tests. Let me outline how to do that with Auth.js.

In the Auth.js configuration file (e.g., `auth.ts`), you can conditionally include providers based on the environment. For example:

```typescript

import { Auth } from "@auth/core"

import Google from "@auth/core/providers/google"

import Credentials from "@auth/core/providers/credentials"

const providers = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ? [

Credentials({

credentials: {

email: { label: "Email", type: "text" },

password: { label: "Password", type: "password" }

},

authorize(credentials) {

// Validate credentials (for testing, accept any)

const user = { id: '1', email: credentials.email }

return user

}

})

] : [

Google({

clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,

clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

})

]

export const authConfig = {

providers,

// ... other config

}

```

Then, in tests, you can set NODE_ENV to 'test' and use the credentials provider to log in without OAuth. But this doesn't test the Google flow. It just bypasses it.

Alternatively, create a mocked Google provider that uses a fake client ID and secret, and intercepts the OAuth flow. This would involve creating a custom provider that mimics Google's OAuth but doesn't perform real authentication.

However, that's complex. Maybe a better approach is to use MSW to intercept the OAuth requests and return mock responses. For example, intercept the request to Google's token endpoint and return a mock access token. Then, in Auth.js, use this token to create a user.

Here's how that might work:

1. Set up MSW to intercept POST requests to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` and return a mock token.

2. In the test, initiate the OAuth flow.

3. The mock response provides a token, which Auth.js uses to fetch user info.

4. Mock the user info endpoint as well to return test user data.

5. Auth.js processes this and creates a session.

This way, the OAuth flow is mocked, and no real Google account is needed.

To set this up:

- Install MSW: `npm install msw --save-dev`

- Create handlers for the Google OAuth endpoints.

- Start the mock server in tests.

Example handler:

```javascript

// test/mocks/handlers.js

import { rest } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [

rest.post('https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token', (req, res, ctx) => {

return res(

ctx.json({

access_token: 'mock_access_token',

expires_in: 3600,

token_type: 'Bearer',

})

)

}),

rest.get('https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo', (req, res, ctx) => {

return res(

ctx.json({

sub: '1234567890',

name: 'Test User',

email: 'test@example.com',

picture: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',

})

)

}),

]

```

Then, in the test setup:

```javascript

// test/setup.js

import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

import { handlers } from './mocks/handlers'

const server = setupServer(...handlers)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())

afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

afterAll(() => server.close())

```

In the test, you can simulate the OAuth callback:

```javascript

// test/login.test.js

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('OAuth login with Google', async ({ page }) => {

await page.goto('/api/auth/signin')

await page.click('button[data-provider="google"]')

// Assuming the OAuth flow redirects to the mock server

// The mock server intercepts the token request and returns mock data

// Auth.js then processes the token and creates a session

await page.waitForURL('/') // Assuming redirect after login

await expect(page.getByText('Test User')).toBeVisible()

})

```

This approach mocks the OAuth server responses, allowing the test to proceed without real accounts. However, it requires correctly intercepting all necessary endpoints and ensuring the Auth.js flow works with the mocked data.

Another consideration: when using Prisma, after the OAuth flow, a user record should be created or updated in the database. The test should check if the user exists in the DB with the expected data. So, in addition to checking the UI, query the database using Prisma to verify the user was persisted correctly.

So, the steps are:

1. Mock the OAuth token and userinfo endpoints using MSW.

2. Simulate the login flow in the test.

3. Verify the session is created in the UI.

4. Check the database for the user record.

This covers both the authentication flow and the integration with Prisma.

Alternatively, if the project uses Next.js with Auth.js, there might be specific testing utilities or examples. Checking the NextAuth.js documentation, they suggest using the credentials provider for testing, but that's more for unit testing. For integration tests, mocking the OAuth provider as above is better.

In summary, the best approach to test OAuth login without real Google accounts is to:

- Use MSW to intercept OAuth-related HTTP requests.

- Mock the responses to simulate a successful OAuth flow.

- Verify both the frontend (session) and backend (database) changes.

This allows comprehensive testing without relying on external services or real user accounts.

To test OAuth login without using real Google accounts in your Prisma, Vercel, and Auth.js project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Mock OAuth Providers with MSW (Mock Service Worker)**
Intercept OAuth API calls and simulate responses.

#### **Install MSW**
```bash
npm install msw --save-dev
```

#### **Create Mock Handlers**
```javascript
// tests/mocks/handlers.js
import { rest } from 'msw';

export const handlers = [
  // Mock Google OAuth token endpoint
  rest.post('https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        access_token: 'mock_google_access_token',
        expires_in: 3600,
        token_type: 'Bearer',
      })
    );
  }),

  // Mock Google userinfo endpoint
  rest.get('https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        sub: 'mock_google_user_id',
        email: 'test@example.com',
        name: 'Test User',
        picture: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
      })
    );
  }),
];
```

#### **Set Up Mock Server**
```javascript
// tests/setup.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
import { handlers } from './mocks/handlers';

const server = setupServer(...handlers);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

---

### 2. **Write End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
Use a testing framework like Playwright or Cypress to simulate user interaction.

#### **Example with Playwright**
```javascript
// tests/oauth.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('Google OAuth login flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to login page
  await page.goto('/api/auth/signin');

  // Click Google login button
  await page.click('button[data-provider="google"]');

  // Verify mock OAuth flow completes
  await page.waitForURL('/'); // Adjust based on your app's post-login redirect

  // Check for user session (e.g., displayed user email)
  await expect(page.getByText('test@example.com')).toBeVisible();
});
```

---

### 3. **Verify Database Integration with Prisma**
Ensure the user is created/updated in your database.

```javascript
// tests/oauth.spec.ts
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';

test('User is created in the database after OAuth login', async () => {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { email: 'test@example.com' },
  });

  expect(user).toMatchObject({
    email: 'test@example.com',
    name: 'Test User',
  });
});
```

---

### 4. **Configure Environment for Testing**
Use test-specific environment variables (e.g., `.env.test`).

```env
# .env.test
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=mock_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=mock_google_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=test_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

### 5. **Run Tests**
Execute tests with mocked OAuth flow.

```bash
NODE_ENV=test playwright test
```

---

### Key Benefits:
- **No Real Accounts Needed:** Avoids using real Google accounts or credentials.
- **Full Flow Testing:** Validates the entire OAuth login process, including token exchange and user creation.
- **Database Verification:** Confirms Prisma correctly persists user data.

This approach ensures your OAuth integration works as expected without relying on external services.
