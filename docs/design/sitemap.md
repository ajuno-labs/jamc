## Website Design Overview

Your project combines a robust **Q&A platform** with a **basic LMS** to create an educational tool where students and teachers can engage through questions, answers, and course content. The LMS provides structure (courses, modules, and notes), while the Q&A system drives interaction and knowledge sharing. The website must be intuitive, with clear navigation between LMS and Q&A sections, and support key features like user management, voting, moderation, and search.

Given the three-month timeline, the design prioritizes:
1. **Essential Pages**: Core functionality for user management, LMS structure, and Q&A system.
2. **Integration**: Seamless links between LMS courses/modules and Q&A discussions.
3. **Scalability**: A structure that allows optional features (like AI enhancements) to be added later.

## Implementation Notes

### Prioritization for Three-Month Timeline
To meet the deadline, focus on the **essential pages** first:
1. **User Management**: Register, Login, Profile (basic version without advanced notifications/subscriptions).
2. **LMS Structure**: Courses, Course Detail (with notes and feedback).
3. **Q&A System**: Q&A Hub, Ask Question, Question Detail (with voting and comments).
4. **Integration**: Course Q&A linking from Course Detail.
5. **Search**: Basic search functionality.

Then, if time remains, add **Leaderboards**, **Moderation Dashboard**, and **About/Help**. Optional AI features (e.g., suggested questions) can be deferred to a later phase.

### Navigation
- **Header**: Persistent across all pages with:
  - Logo (links to `/`).
  - Search bar (triggers `/search`).
  - Links: Courses (`/courses`), Q&A (`/questions`), Profile (`/profile`).
  - Teacher-specific: Moderation link (if separate dashboard is built).
- **Breadcrumbs**: On `Course Detail`, `Course Q&A`, and `Question Detail` for easy back-navigation.

### Tech Stack Alignment
- **Next.js App Router**: Use dynamic routes (e.g., `/courses/[courseId]`) for scalability.
- **Auth.js**: Implement role-based access (students vs. teachers) for teacher-specific controls.
- **PostgreSQL/Prisma**: Store users, courses, modules, questions, answers, and votes in a relational structure.

## Final Thoughts
This sitemap and page design provide a clear, actionable plan for your website. The essential pages cover all “must-have” features from your scope—user management, Q&A system, LMS integration, search, voting, and moderation—while leaving room for “nice-to-have” enhancements. By integrating teacher controls into existing pages (e.g., `Course Detail`, `Question Detail`), you can streamline development within three months, then expand with standalone dashboards or AI features later.
