# Course Structure

## Current State

- given my project, I want you to give me ways to design the course. Like how would a course be structured. 

- SGK Toán 10
    - Hỗn hợp các thành phần, được chia làm 2 tập.
    - không phân biệt rõ ràng giữa các chủ đề.
    - có nhiều hoạt động thực nghiệm và bài toán thực tế.

## Proposed Structure

### Solution 1

- Prioritize the common course structure.
- Course: is a collection of modules.
- Modules: are chapters in both books, doesn't care about the book episodes.
- Lessons

### Solution 2

- Prioritize the book structure.
- Course > Volume > Chapter > Module > Lesson

## Decision

- Even though I like the more abstract course structure, I would want this platform to be loved by teachers and students and it should feel familiar to them so yeah I guess I'll go with the second solution.


## AI Suggestion

Based on your query, I’ll address your concerns about the sitemap design for the course structure (**Course > Volumes > Chapters > Modules > Lessons > Activities/Problems**) and how features like embedded Q&A, progress tracking, and others are distributed across these levels. You’re worried that volumes and chapters might just be “names” with no substance, and you want to know where the features will live—whether they’re restricted to modules and lessons or spread out. You’ve also noted that activities/problems will be text-based with descriptions and possibly linked to Q&A, not handled gracefully otherwise. I’ll design the feature integration accordingly, keeping it simple and focused, and briefly touch on scalability for other Vietnamese high school subjects as a side note, per your request.

## Sitemap and Feature Distribution

Here’s how the sitemap and features are structured across each level of your platform. The goal is to ensure every page has meaningful content—not just names—and that features are distributed sensibly, given your system’s limitations (e.g., text-based activities/problems).

### 1. Course Page (`/courses/[courseId]`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Course Title**: e.g., "SGK Toán 10" (Math 10 Textbook).
  - **Course Description**: A short text overview of the course (e.g., "Covers algebra and geometry for grade 10").
  - **Volumes List**: Links to volumes (e.g., "Tập 1", "Tập 2").
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: A section for general course-related questions (e.g., "What’s the best way to study SGK Toán 10?").
  - **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar showing how many volumes or chapters you’ve completed (optional, toggleable).
- **Purpose**: This isn’t just a “name” page—it gives context and lets users ask broad questions about the course.

### 2. Volume Page (`/courses/[courseId]/[volumeId]`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Volume Title**: e.g., "Tập 1" (Volume 1).
  - **Volume Overview**: A brief text summary of what this volume covers (e.g., "Focuses on algebra fundamentals").
  - **Chapters List**: Links to chapters (e.g., "Chương 1: Quadratic Functions").
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: For volume-specific questions (e.g., "What topics are in Tập 1?").
  - **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar for chapters completed in this volume (optional).
- **Purpose**: More than a name—it provides an overview and supports volume-level Q&A, so it’s useful even without diving deeper.

### 3. Chapter Page (`/courses/[courseId]/[volumeId]/[chapterId]`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Chapter Title**: e.g., "Chương 1: Quadratic Functions".
  - **Chapter Introduction**: A text intro to the chapter’s key concepts (e.g., "Learn about parabolas and equations").
  - **Modules List**: Links to modules (e.g., "Bài 1: Properties of Quadratic Functions").
  - **Chapter Summary**: Key takeaways or formulas (e.g., "Standard form: \( ax^2 + bx + c \)").
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: For chapter-specific questions (e.g., "How do I solve quadratic equations?").
  - **LaTeX Support**: Used in the summary and intro for math notation.
- **Purpose**: This page offers an introduction and summary, not just a name, and supports chapter-level discussions via Q&A.

### 4. Module Page (`/courses/[courseId]/[volumeId]/[chapterId]/[moduleId]`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Module Title**: e.g., "Bài 1: Properties of Quadratic Functions".
  - **Module Introduction**: A short text explanation of the module’s focus (e.g., "Covers vertex and roots").
  - **Lessons List**: Links to lessons (e.g., "Tiết 1: Standard Form").
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: For module-specific questions (e.g., "What’s the vertex form?").
  - **Progress Tracking**: Checkboxes for lesson completion (optional).
  - **Feedback Form**: A simple form to rate or comment on the module.
- **Purpose**: Acts as a hub for lessons with its own Q&A and feedback, keeping it interactive.

### 5. Lesson Page (`/courses/[courseId]/[volumeId]/[chapterId]/[moduleId]/[lessonId]`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Lesson Title**: e.g., "Tiết 1: Standard Form".
  - **Theory**: Detailed text explanation (e.g., "The standard form is \( ax^2 + bx + c \)").
  - **Examples**: Text-based examples with step-by-step solutions (e.g., "Solve \( x^2 - 4 = 0 \)").
  - **Links to Activities**: Text links to the activities/problems page.
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: For lesson-specific questions (e.g., "How do I factor this?").
  - **LaTeX Support**: Used in theory and examples.
  - **Gamification**: Earn points for completing the lesson or posting in Q&A.
- **Purpose**: The core learning content lives here, with Q&A and examples enhancing it.

### 6. Activities/Problems Page (`/courses/[courseId]/[volumeId]/[chapterId]/[moduleId]/[lessonId]/activities`)
- **What You See**: 
  - **Activity Title**: e.g., "Hoạt Động 1: Graphing Quadratics".
  - **Description**: Text instructions (e.g., "Plot \( y = x^2 - 4 \) on graph paper").
  - **Problem Sets**: Text exercises (e.g., "Solve \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \)").
  - **Hints/Answers**: Optional text hints (e.g., "Factor as \( (x + 3)(x - 1) \)").
- **Features**:
  - **Embedded Q&A**: For activity-specific questions (e.g., "Why does the graph open upwards?").
  - **LaTeX Support**: Used in descriptions and problems.
  - **Gamification**: Earn points for completing problems or engaging in Q&A.
- **Purpose**: Simple, text-based practice with Q&A support—links back to Q&A rather than handling solutions internally.

## Feature Distribution Summary

You asked whether features like embedded Q&A and tracking are handled only within modules or lessons. The answer is **no**—they’re spread across all levels to ensure every page is functional and engaging:

- **Embedded Q&A**: Available at **every level** (course, volume, chapter, module, lesson, activities). Questions are filtered to match the page’s scope (e.g., course-level Q&A stays broad, lesson-level gets specific).
- **Progress Tracking**: Optional at **course, volume, chapter, and module** levels (e.g., progress bars or checkboxes). Not needed at lessons or activities since completion is tracked higher up.
- **LaTeX Support**: Used wherever math notation is needed—**chapter summaries, lesson theory, examples, and activities**.
- **Gamification**: Points earned at **lessons and activities** for completion or Q&A participation; badges visible in user profiles.
- **Feedback**: Limited to **modules**, where users can rate/comment on content.

This distribution ensures that volumes and chapters aren’t just “names”—they have overviews, summaries, and Q&A to make them useful standalone pages. Modules and lessons carry the bulk of the detailed content, while activities/problems stay lightweight and text-based, as you specified.

## Handling Activities/Problems

Since your system won’t handle activities gracefully, they’re kept simple:
- **Text-Based**: Problems and instructions are text-only (e.g., "Solve \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \)").
- **Q&A Linked**: No built-in solution checker—just a description and an embedded Q&A section where users can ask for help (e.g., "How do I solve this?").
- **No Fancy Features**: No interactive graphs or auto-grading—just text and optional hints, aligning with your constraints.

This keeps the system lean while still supporting student practice.

## Side Note: Scalability to Other Subjects

You mentioned checking scalability for other Vietnamese high school subjects (e.g., Physics, Literature). This structure works well:
- **Physics**: Course ("SGK Vật Lý 10") > Volumes ("Tập 1: Mechanics") > Chapters ("Chương 1: Kinematics") > Modules ("Bài 1: Uniform Motion") > Lessons ("Tiết 1: Speed") > Activities ("Measure speed with a stopwatch").
- **Literature**: Course ("SGK Ngữ Văn 10") > Volumes ("Tập 1: Poetry") > Chapters ("Chương 1: Folk Literature") > Modules ("Bài 1: Epic Poems") > Lessons ("Tiết 1: Đăm Săn") > Activities ("Write a summary").
- The text-based approach for activities (e.g., descriptions or essay prompts) adapts easily to different subjects.

It’s scalable, but since you want to finish quickly, I won’t dwell on this—just know it’s flexible enough to handle other curricula.

## Final Answer

Your sitemap ensures that **volumes and chapters are more than just names**—they include overviews, summaries, and embedded Q&A, making them useful pages. Features like Q&A, progress tracking, and LaTeX are **distributed across all levels**, not just modules or lessons, to keep the platform engaging. Activities/problems are **text-based with descriptions and Q&A links**, staying simple as per your system’s limitations. This design balances functionality and simplicity, and it’s ready to roll without overcomplicating things. Let me know if you need tweaks!
