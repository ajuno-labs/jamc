Your concern is valid—students in Vietnam (and many other places) often hesitate to ask questions, which can hinder engagement and limit the full potential of your platform. If students don’t change their habits, JAMC could just end up being another passive learning platform like an LMS + Q&A forum.

Here are some potential solutions:

### **1. Culture Shift: Making Asking Questions the Norm**
- **Anonymous Q&A Mode**: Allow students to ask questions anonymously (many hesitate due to fear of judgment).
- **AI Nudges & Suggestions**: If a student struggles on a quiz, the system can suggest, “Would you like to ask a question about this topic?”.
- **Gamification with Leaderboards**: Highlight and reward students who ask quality questions, not just answer them.
- **Teacher Encouragement**: Teachers should model curiosity by posting "starter questions" to normalize asking.

### **2. Social Features to Encourage Discussion**
- **Community-Led Study Groups**: Students can earn rewards for helping each other rather than just relying on teachers.
- **Live AI Chatbot Tutor**: If students hesitate to ask humans, an AI tutor could be a stepping stone to real discussions.
- **Discussion-Based Learning**: Instead of just Q&A, include small group discussions (e.g., structured debates or problem-solving).

### **3. Automating Question Generation**
- If students won’t ask questions, **AI can generate them!**  
  - After a video or quiz, the system could auto-generate questions based on common misunderstandings.
  - It could say, “Here’s a question you might have—click to see the answer or discuss with peers.”

### **4. Streamlining Management Complexity**
- **Centralized AI Dashboard**: If handling Q&A + LMS is overwhelming, use AI to automate moderation, summarize discussion trends, and flag critical unanswered questions.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Differentiate between teachers, moderators, and student helpers to balance workload.

### **Final Thought**
Your platform needs to go beyond **"content delivery"** and actively **shape learning habits.** If you can make **question-asking feel easy, valuable, and rewarding**, JAMC can differentiate itself from generic online education platforms.
