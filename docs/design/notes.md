- **Requirements**
    - Enhance the personalized learning experience for **students**.
        - Teacher can pack the concrete part of lectures, and focusing on answering questions and providing guidance for each student with personal tracking.
            - They can sell that concrete part of lectures too.
            - From now on, we can call that concrete part of lectures as "**modules**".
        - Q&A/forum: students freely asking questions and discuss with others and teachers.
            - I'm thinking of dividing questions into categories.
                - private and public questions, regarding to visibility outside of a class.
                - freely asked question and formatted formal questions. Or I can call them as "**yolo**" and "**formal**" questions.
            - This feature needs to be somehow linked to the tracking system aka LMS, allows teachers to track students' progress and individual engagement in classes.
            - For formal questions, we want a systematic way to handle this
                - Predefined format
                - AI-generated answers based on existing data.
                - Check for existing answers
                - Tags
                    - AI-suggested tags
                    - Predefined tags
                    - User-defined tags: 
                        - How do we validate the tags? Admin, AI-based?
        - LMS/Tracking system: teachers can track students' progress and individual engagement in classes.
            - Tracking learning progress, engagement, and performance.
            - Actually, we might want to think exactly what to be tracked here.
    - Module 
        - Monetization: teachers can sell the modules which are concrete parts for students outside of that class.
            - We need to think exactly how the monetization system should be.
                - Students within a real class should be able to access the modules for free.
                - Students outside can purchase the modules. How do they purchase the modules?
                    - How do we handle the payment?
                        - Payment services?
                    - Freemium model:
                        - Trials for every module?
                        - I think each teacher would want to price their own modules. Because it depends on the effort. The system can't decide the price.
            - We could have a recommendation system for students to purchase modules based on personal style and reviews for the modules.
                - Recommendation probably would be AI based here.
                - How exactly can we track the personal style?
                    - Frequently asked questions, accessed modules?
        - Plugins system: allow teachers to customize the structure of the modules according to their own needs.
    - Authentication and authorization
        - OAuth
        - Passkey?
        - Credentials are now deprecated, there are much more better ways.
        - We want three roles: student, teacher, admin.
    - Administration
        - User management: CRUD, block/unblock, approve teacher accounts.
            - So teacher accounts need to be approved.
        - Module management
        - User activity tracking: What to track? How would this affect the database and stuff?
        - System monitoring: How to monitor the system? I don't even know what to be monitored.
        - Q&A management: How to manage the questions? How to manage the answers? Tags?
        - Can we implement AI-based stuff to reduce the effort for admin?

- Design
    - UI design
        - We like to have a shared apology page for unimplemented pages.
    - Database design
