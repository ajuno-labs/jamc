## Components

Let’s structure the feature design into **core components**, prioritizing engagement, scalability, and alignment with Vietnam’s educational context. I’ll break this down into workflows, technical specs, and mitigation strategies for potential risks.

### **1. Feature Prioritization & Design Goals**
| **Priority** | **Feature**                     | **Objective**                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P0           | AI-Powered Q&A with Gamification| Solve engagement gaps by incentivizing questions and reducing teacher workload. |
| P0           | Adaptive Learning Engine        | Personalize content delivery to address diverse learning paces.              |
| P1           | Module Monetization Marketplace | Empower teachers to earn revenue while expanding access to quality content.  |
| P1           | LMS & Progress Tracking         | Provide actionable insights for teachers and students.                       |
| P2           | Admin Automation Tools          | Reduce manual moderation via AI-driven tagging/approval.                     |

### **2. Core Features & Technical Specifications**
#### **A. Q&A System with Engagement Hooks**
- **Question Types**:
  - **YOLO (Informal)**: Free-form text/audio; auto-tagged by AI (e.g., "Algebra – Quadratic Equations").
  - **Formal**: Structured template (Topic, Description, Attachments) linked to curriculum standards.
- **Visibility Modes**:
  - **Public**: Visible to entire class; answers benefit all.
  - **Private**: Only visible to teacher + asker (e.g., sensitive topics).
- **AI Integration**:
  - **Answer Suggestions**: Use NLP (TensorFlow) to surface similar past answers or module snippets.
  - **Tag Validation**: Hybrid model – AI suggests tags, teachers/admins can edit/approve.
- **Gamification**:
  - **Credits**: 10 pts/upvoted question, 15 pts/answered question, -5 pts for downvoted (anti-spam).
  - **Leaderboards**: Weekly "Top Contributors" per class (anonymizable for shy students).

#### **B. Adaptive Learning Engine**
- **Module Structure**:
  - **Core Modules**: Free for enrolled students; aligned with MOET curriculum.
  - **Premium Modules**: Teacher-created; priced $5–$20 (set by teacher).
- **Adaptivity Logic**:
  - **Difficulty Adjustment**: Uses quiz retry rates and time-per-question (PyTorch model).
  - **Milestone Alerts**: Triggered when a student’s progress deviates >15% from class average.
- **Recommendation System**:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: “Students who took Module X also bought Y.”
  - **Performance-Based**: Suggests modules addressing weak areas (e.g., "Struggling with Geometry? Try this module").

#### **C. Module Monetization**
- **Access Control**:
  - **Enrolled Students**: Free access via class code.
  - **External Students**: Purchase via Stripe/ local gateways (VNPay, MoMo).
- **Teacher Dashboard**:
  - **Pricing Analytics**: Shows average rates for similar modules (e.g., “Algebra modules average $12”).
  - **Revenue Split**: Automatically calculated (70% teacher, 20% platform, 10% fees).
- **Refund Policy**: 24-hour free trial for premium modules.

#### **D. LMS & Progress Tracking**
- **Student Profile**:
  - **Learning Graph**: Visualizes progress across modules (completion %, quiz scores).
  - **Engagement Score**: Combines question contributions, peer interactions, and login frequency.
- **Teacher Dashboard**:
  - **Heatmaps**: Highlights topics with the most questions (e.g., 80% of students struggled with calculus).
  - **Intervention Flags**: AI identifies at-risk students (e.g., 3+ missed milestones).

#### **E. Authentication & Security**
- **Roles**:
  - **Student**: Facial recognition liveness check + class code.
  - **Teacher**: Government ID verification (e.g., CCCD) + manual admin approval.
  - **Admin**: Two-factor authentication.
- **Data Security**:
  - **Anonymization**: All public questions use pseudonyms (e.g., “Student123”).
  - **GDPR Compliance**: Servers hosted in Vietnam; parental consent for under-16s.

### **3. Workflow Diagrams**
#### **Student Journey**:
1. **Onboard** → Facial scan + class code → **Learn** → Watch module → **Engage** → Ask YOLO question → **Earn** → Redeem credits for premium content.

#### **Teacher Journey**:
1. **Verify** → Submit ID → **Create** → Upload module → **Monetize** → Set price → **Track** → Monitor student heatmaps.

### **4. Risk Mitigation**
| **Risk**                          | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low student engagement in Q&A     | Default to anonymous mode; AI-generated "starter questions" to seed discussions.        |
| Module plagiarism                 | AI similarity check (≥80% match blocks upload); teacher reporting tools.                |
| Payment fraud                     | Integrate VNPay’s anti-fraud API; limit refunds to 1/month.                             |
| Rural access barriers             | Offline mode for modules; SMS-based Q&A (Twilio integration).                           |
